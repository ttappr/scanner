# scanner
A simple example of a hand written lexer that can be used to scan and tokenize text.

This approach can be useful for writing simple text tokenizers or scanners. Alternatives to this approach include regular expressions as provided by the 
[regex crate](https://docs.rs/regex/1.5.4/regex/), and parser generators like [ANTLR](https://docs.rs/antlr-rust/0.2.0/antlr_rust/), or other 
toos and frameworks for developing lexers and/or parsers.
