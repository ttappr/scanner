# scanner
A simple example project for a hand written lexer that can be used to scan and 
tokenize text. This is simply an example project to pull ideas from; the code
in its current state is largely untested.

This approach can be useful for writing simple text tokenizers or scanners. 
Alternatives to this approach include regular expressions as provided by the 
[regex crate](https://docs.rs/regex/1.5.4/regex/), and parser generators like 
[ANTLR](https://docs.rs/antlr-rust/0.2.0/antlr_rust/) for more extensive
text processing requirements.
