# scanner
A simple example project for a hand written lexer that can be used to scan and 
tokenize text.

This approach can be useful for writing simple text tokenizers or scanners. 
Alternatives to this approach include regular expressions as provided by the 
[regex crate](https://docs.rs/regex/1.5.4/regex/), and parser generators like 
[ANTLR](https://docs.rs/antlr-rust/0.2.0/antlr_rust/), or other tools and 
frameworks for developing lexers and/or parsers.
